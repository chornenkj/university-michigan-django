First, this repository contained scripts I have created while passed the course of
University of Michigan 'Django for everybody'.

Now, I use PythonAnywhere service and this repo to locate my own project apps.

Some apps require user login. So to check these apps functionality, please, use one of the predefined users credentials:
<ul>
  <li>user login: dj4e_user1, password: Meow_f9b784_41</li>
  <li>user login: dj4e_user2, password: Meow_42_f9b784</li>
</ul>
  
## My project apps are the follows:

## Ads CRUD, Users and Pictures
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/ads/>
Ads app let you create ads. <em>App functionality includes</em>:
<ul>
<li>You can create, retrieve, update and delete your ads using your login account.</li>
<li>You can also browse ads of other users, but you are not allowed to edit or delete them.</li>
<li>You can add and update pictures for each ad.</li>
<li>You can comment all ads and delete your comments.</li>
</ul>

## Generate UNESCO Database
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/unesco/>
This app uses script which loads data from csv-file 'unesco.csv' and generates an SQLite database of UNESCO sites.<br/>

You can browse and download both files from the link <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/site/unesco/>

It is my game to guess a number. Your game is saved to session, so you can continue anytime you like.

Cats CRUD app let you create Breeds, and create Cats on their base.<br/>

<em>Also add a link to python script which refreshes Cats and Breeds database uploading it from csv-file.</em>

## Files Browser
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/site/>
You can browse my working files, such as 'meow.csv' file which contains data to refresh Cats database,<br/>
and 'unesco.csv' and 'unesco.sqlite3' for UNESCO app.

## Autos CRUD
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/autos/>
Autos app let you create Makes, and create Autos on their base.<br/>
You can create, retrieve, update and delete data (Makes and Autos) with this app.

## Polls

This app is to vote to the Questions. Questions are set in admin. So you cannot add your ones.

## Test the session
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/hello/>
This app just uses session to keep amount of page loads. If it is greater than 4, it refreshes.
