First, this repository contained scripts I have created while passed the course of
University of Michigan 'Django for everybody'.

Now, I use PythonAnywhere service and this repo to locate my own project apps.

Some apps require user login. So to check these apps functionality, please, use one of the predefined users credentials:
<ul>
  <li>user login: dj4e_user1, password: Meow_fb5185_41</li>
  <li>user login: dj4e_user2, password: Meow_42_fb5185</li>
</ul>
  
## My project apps are the follows:

## Generate UNESCO Database
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/unesco/>
This app uses script which loads data from csv-file 'unesco.csv' and generates an SQLite database of UNESCO sites.<br/>
This database is separated from the default project database (MySQL).<br/>
You can browse and download both files from the link <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/site/unesco/>

## Guess game

It is my game to guess a number. Your game is saved to session, so you can continue anytime you like.

Cats CRUD app let you create Breeds, and create Cats on their base.<br/>
You can create, retrieve, update and delete data (Breeds and Cats).<br/>

Also add a link to python script which refreshes Cats and Breeds database uploading it from csv-file.

This app is to vote to the Questions. Questions are set in admin. So you cannot add your ones.

## Test the session

This app just uses session to keep amount of page loads. If it is greater than 4, it refreshes.

the skills I have obtained on the course.
