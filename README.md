#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/>
First, this repository contained scripts I have created while passed the course of
University of Michigan 'Django for everybody'.

But later on, I used this PythonAnywhere service to locate my own project apps.

## My project apps are as follows:

## 1. Guess game
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/guess/>
It is my game to guess a number. Your game is saved to session, so you can continue anytime you like.

## 2. Cats CRUD
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/cats/>
Cats CRUD app let you create Breeds, and create Cats on their base.<br/>
You can create, retrieve, update and delete data (Breeds and Cats).<br/>
This app requires login. Use username 'freeuser' and password '1256qwty' to get access.<br/>
Also add a link to python script which refreshes Cats and Breeds database uploading it from csv-file.

## 3. Files Browser
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/site/>
You can browse my working files, such as 'meow.csv' file which contains data to refresh Cats database.

## 4. Autos CRUD
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/autos/>
Autos app let you create Makes, and create Autos on their base.<br/>
You can create, retrieve, update and delete data (Makes and Autos) with this app.<br/>
This app requires login. Use username 'freeuser' and password '1256qwty' to get access.

## 5. A Polls Application
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/polls/>
This app is to vote to the Questions. Questions are set in admin. So you cannot add your ones.

## 6. Test the session
#### URL : <https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/hello/>
This app just uses session to keep amount of page loads. If it is greater than 4, it refreshes.

!!!This is not for use of other learners, but instead it is to demonstrate
the skills I have obtained on the course.
