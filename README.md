# university-michigan-django

First, this repository contained scripts I have created while passed the course of
University of Michigan 'Django for everybody'.

But later on, I used this PythonAnywhere service to locate my own project.
URL : https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/
So, my projects are as follows:

1. Guess game - is my game to guess a number. Your game is saved to session, so you can continue anytime you like.
URL : https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/guess/

2. Cats CRUD - Cats CRUD app let you create Breeds, and create Cats on their base. You can create, retrieve, update and delete data (Breeds and Cats)
URL : https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/cats/

3. Autos CRUD - Autos app let you create Makes, and create Autos on their base. You can create, retrieve, update and delete data (Makes and Autos) with this app. This app requires login. Use username 'freeuser' and password '1256qwty' to get access.
URL : https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/autos/

4. A Polls Application - this app is to vote to the Questions. Questions are set in admin. So you cannot add your ones.
URL : https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/polls/

5. Test the session - this app just uses session to keep amount of page loads. If it is greater than 4, it refreshes.
URL : https://chornenkj.pythonanywhere.com/hello/

!!!This is not for use of other learners, but instead it is to demonstrate
the skills I have obtained on the course.
